                <h2>Women Education Barriers</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey, ever wonder why fewer girls tend to pick computing classes in school? Well, here are some reasons:
                    Stereotypes: You know how sometimes people think computing is just for guys? That can totally turn girls away from it. 
                    Research shows girls are less likely to sign up for computing classes if they think it's a "guy thing."
                    Lack of Role Models: It's hard to imagine yourself doing something if you don't see people who look like you doing it. 
                    Since there aren't as many female role models in computing, girls might not feel like it's something they can do.
                    Limited Exposure: Maybe you haven't had many chances to play around with computers at school or home. 
                    That lack of exposure can make it tough to get excited about computing and can make you doubt your own skills.
                    Gender Bias: Sometimes, girls get treated differently in computing classes. They might not get chosen for leadership 
                    roles as often, or teachers might not give them as much attention. That can really mess with your confidence and interest in the subject.
                    Media Stereotypes: Have you noticed how often girls in movies or TV shows are shown doing other stuff besides coding or working with computers? 
                    It can make it seem like computing isn't something girls are supposed to do. To fix these issues, we need to make classrooms more welcoming to girls. 
                    That means showing them that computing is for everyone! We can do that by having more diverse role models, giving everyone a chance to explore computing, 
                    and making sure girls get treated just like boys in class. When we make computing more inclusive, 
                    we get to benefit from all the awesome ideas and skills that girls bring to the table!
